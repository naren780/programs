                    Early medieval India began after the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE.[137] This period also covers the "Late Classical Age" of Hinduism,[186] which began after the end of the Gupta Empire,[186] and the collapse of the Empire of Harsha in the 7th century CE;[186] the beginning of Imperial Kannauj, leading to the Tripartite struggle; and ended in the 13th century with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in Northern India[187] and the end of the Later Cholas with the death of Rajendra Chola III in 1279 in Southern India; however some aspects of the Classical period continued until the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south around the 17th century.</artical>

The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in</article>
